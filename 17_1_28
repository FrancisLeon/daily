Today I read the a few pages of algorithm (princeton). I plan to complete read it in one month as well as finish the class accordingly.

Then I study the RL project, since I modify the code of Wayne. I plan to run it rawly. But the problem is still the database. I will try to 
run it in pythonscript to gain the condensed data. Also, I will discuss with Ian the comment of the data. Tomorrow.

And now I start to go the leetcode in refer to others' codes. I plan to go over it for first pass in 2 months.
